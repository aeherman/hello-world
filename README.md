See shiny.io website [here](https://ukipv4-connie-xu.shinyapps.io/Group_G_HigherEd_Review/) <br>
This website visualizes student loans over time and was created for the final project of the course, Data Visualization, in Spring 2021.  It was the result of a team effort, and Arielle contributed by:
1. building the structure of the shiny website
2. visualizing the repayment rate trends under student loans
