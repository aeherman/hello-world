This website visualizes student loans over time and was created for the final project of the course, Data Visualization, in Spring 2021.  It was the result of a team effort, and Arielle contributed by:
1. building the structure of the shiny website
2. visualizing the repayment rate trends under student loans

This package was created as the final project for the course, Modern Data Structures in Fall 2020.  This package facilitates access to the British Columbia Library archives. It has three functions:

3. one that comapares different fields in two selected lists of fields in a collection
